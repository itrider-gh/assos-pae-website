The backend is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/fr/), it is using a MySQL server to store its data and the authentification and users infos retrievement is handled by the [Portail des Assos](https://github.com/simde-utc/portail).

The frontend is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) and calls the API through the Axios plugin.
